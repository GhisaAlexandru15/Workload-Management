Program that monitors the training of a football team in the Romanian 3rd League.</br>
After each training, the players submit on Google Form how difficult it was, on a scale from 1 to 10.</br>
Based on the generated csv file, the program calculates different parameters, based on which you can see if the workload is optimal. Undertraining or excesive load increases the risk of injuries.</br>
The final data is presented in the form of an Excel document, generated by a Bash script.</br>
(it works, but it's still in progress - i still need to manually edit some mistakes in the answers)</br>
